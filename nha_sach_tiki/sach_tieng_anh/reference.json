Why are there dozens of varieties of mustard-but only one variety of ketchup? What do football players teach us about how to hire teachers? What does hair dye tell us about the history of the 20th century?In the past decade, Malcolm Gladwell has written three books that have radically changed how we understand our world and ourselves: The Tipping Point; Blink; and Outliers. Now, in What the Dog Saw, he brings together, for the first time, the best of his writing from The New Yorker over the same period.Here is the bittersweet tale of the inventor of the birth control pill, and the dazzling inventions of the pasta sauce pioneer Howard Moscowitz. Gladwell sits with Ron Popeil, the king of the American kitchen, as he sells rotisserie ovens, and divines the secrets of Cesar Millan, the \"dog whisperer\" who can calm savage animals with the touch of his hand. He explores intelligence tests and ethnic profiling and \"hindsight bias\" and why it was that everyone in Silicon Valley once tripped over themselves to hire the same college graduate.\"Good writing,\" Gladwell says in his preface, \"does not succeed or fail on the strength of its ability to persuade. It succeeds or fails on the strength of its ability to engage you, to make you think, to give you a glimpse into someone else's head.\" What the Dog Saw is yet another example of the buoyant spirit and unflagging curiosity that have made Malcolm Gladwell our most brilliant investigator of the hidden extraordinary.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/4/1/41drkn1rysl-_sx325_bo1-204-203-200_.u2487.d20161031.t150516.459981.jpg"]},{"name":"New American Inside Out Inter: Workbook With Audio CD","brand":"Sue Kay","price":"165.000 ₫","description":"New American Inside Out Inter: Workbook With Audio CD","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51wdddagwml-_sx349_bo1-204-203-200_.u2487.d20161010.t113958.359900.jpg"]},{"name":"New American Inside Out Upper-Inter: Student Book With CD-Rom","brand":"Sue Kay","price":"165.000 ₫","description":"New American Inside Out Upper-Inter: Student Book With CD-Rom","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/510oxo47l-l-_sx351_bo1-204-203-200_.u2487.d20161010.t113612.166432.jpg"]},{"name":"OpenMind 2: Student Book","brand":"MACMILLAN HEINEMANN","price":"104.000 ₫","description":"OpenMind 2: Student Book","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/i/m/img341.u335.d20161230.t141301.855897.jpg"]},{"name":"Take Shape 4: Student Book With E-Readers","brand":"PAUL A.

In theory, he argues, the world's wealthiest countries and supra-national institutions like the IMF, World Bank and WTO want to see all nations developing into modern industrial societies. In practice, though, those at the top are 'kicking away the ladder' to wealth that they themselves climbed. Why? Self-interest certainly plays a part. But, more often, rich and powerful governments and institutions are actually being 'Bad Samaritans': their intentions are worthy but their simplistic free-market ideology and poor understanding of history leads them to inflict policy errors on others. Chang demonstrates this by contrasting the route to success of economically vibrant countries with the very different route now being dictated to the world's poorer nations. In the course of this, he shows just how muddled the thinking is in such key areas as trade and foreign investment. He shows that the case for privatisation and against state involvement is far from proven. And he explores the ways in which attitudes to national cultures and political ideologies are obscuring clear thinking and creating bad policy. Finally, he argues the case for new strategies for a more prosperous world that may appall the 'Bad Samaritans'.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781905211371.u53.d20160829.t143052.379734.jpg"]},{"name":"Just Kids (Paperback)","brand":"Patti Smith","price":"129.000 ₫","description":"Just Kids\r\nA prelude to fame, Just Kids recounts the friendship of two youngartists Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe - whose passion fueled their lifelong pursuit of art.\r\nIn 1967, a chance meeting betweentwo young people led to a romance and a lifelong friendship that would carry each to international success never dreamed of. The backdrop is Brooklyn, Chelsea Hotel, Max's Kansas City, Scribner's Bookstore, Coney Island, Warhol's Factory and the whole city resplendent. Among their friends, literary lights, musicians and artists such as Harry Smith, Bobby Neuwirth, Allen Ginsberg, Sandy Daley, Sam Shepherd, William Burroughs, etc. It was a heightened time politically and culturally; theart and music worlds exploding and colliding.
