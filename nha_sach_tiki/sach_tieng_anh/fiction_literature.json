Their mutual attraction quickly grows into the kind of love that leaves Savannah waiting for John to finish his tour of duty, and John wanting to settle down with the woman who captured his heart. But 9/11 changes everything.  John feels it is his duty to re-enlist. And sadly, the long separation finds Savannah falling in love with someone else. \"Dear John,\" the letter read...and with those two words, a heart was broken and two lives were changed forever.

Here are animated crows, a criminal monkey, and an iceman, as well as the dreams that shape us and the things we might wish for. Whether during a chance reunion in Italy, a romantic exile in Greece, a holiday in Hawaii, or in the grip of everyday life, Murakami’s characters confront grievous loss, or sexuality, or the glow of a firefly, or the impossible distances between those who ought to be closest of all."},{"name":"Ice: A Novel","author":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/author/linda-howard.html\">Linda Howard</a>","price":"165.000 ₫","description":"On holiday leave from the service, Gabriel McQueen is sent into a brewing ice storm to make sure that his father’s distant neighbor, Lolly Helton, who has fallen out of contact, is safe and sound. It’s a trip that Gabriel would rather not make, given the bitter winter weather—and the icy conditions that have always existed between him and Lolly. Arriving at Lolly’s home, Gabriel spots strangers through the windows—one of them packing a weapon—and kicks into combat mode. But once Lolly is rescued, the heat—and the hunt—are on. Snowbound, unarmed, and literally under the gun, Gabriel and Lolly must depend on each other to endure the merciless forces of nature and evade the ruthless enemy out in the blackness of the silent night—and out for their blood."},{"name":"The Wedding (Mass Market Paperback)","author":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/author/nicholas-sparks.html\">Nicholas Sparks</a>","price":"109.000 ₫","description":"With The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and his other beloved novels, #1 New York Times bestselling author Nicholas Sparks has given voice to our deepest beliefs about the power of love. Now he brings us the long-awaited follow-up to The Notebook-a story of an ordinary man who goes to extraordinary lengths to win back the love of his life... After thirty years, Wilson Lewis is forced to face a painful truth: the romance has gone out of his marriage. His wife, Jane, has fallen out of love with him, and it is entirely his fault. Despite the shining example of his in-laws, Noah and Allie Calhoun, and their fifty-year love affair (originally recounted in The Notebook), Wilson himself is a man unable to express his true feelings. He has spent too little time at home and too much at the office, leaving the responsibility of raising their children to Jane. Now his daughter is about to marry, and his wife is thinking about leaving him. But if Wilson is sure of anything, it is this: His love for Jane has only grown over the years, and he will do everything he can to save their marriage. With the memories of Noah and Allie's inspiring life together as his guide, he vows to find a way to make his wife fall in love with him...all over again. In this powerfully moving tale of love lost, rediscovered, and renewed, Nicholas Sparks once again brings readers his unique insight into the only emotion that ultimately really matters."},{"name":"True Believer","author":null,"price":"109.000 ₫","description":"Jeremy Marsh is a born skeptic and a science journalist who specializes in debunking the supernatural.

A GOD IN RUINS tells the dramatic story of the 20th Century through Ursula's beloved younger brother Teddy--would-be poet, heroic pilot, husband, father, and grandfather-as he navigates the perils and progress of a rapidly changing world. After all that Teddy endures in battle, his greatest challenge is living in a future he never expected to have. An ingenious and moving exploration of one ordinary man's path through extraordinary times, A GOD IN RUINS proves once again that Kate Atkinson is one of the finest novelists of our age."},{"name":"Solomon Creed: The Only Thriller You Need To Read This Year","author":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/author/simon-toyne.html\">Simon Toyne</a>","price":"156.000 ₫","description":"Solomon Creed: The Only Thriller You Need To Read This Year"},{"name":"Beasts Of Olympus #3: Steeds Of The Gods","author":null,"price":"121.000 ₫","description":"Beasts Of Olympus #3: Steeds Of The Gods"},{"name":"The Cardturner","author":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/author/louis-sachar.html\">Louis Sachar</a>","price":"165.000 ₫","description":"The Cardturner"},{"name":"The Maze Runner Series","author":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/author/james-dashner.html\">James Dashner</a>","price":"961.000 ₫","description":"The Maze Runner Series"},{"name":"No Turning Back (The Originals)","author":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/author/beverley-naidoo.html\">Beverley Naidoo</a>","price":"180.000 ₫","description":"No Turning Back (The Originals)"},{"name":"Rip Van Winkle, The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories","author":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/author/washington-irving.html\">Washington Irving</a>","price":"60.000 ₫","description":"Rip Van Winkle, The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories"},{"name":"14th Deadly Sin","author":null,"price":"161.000 ₫","description":"14th Deadly Sin"},{"name":"Disclaimer","author":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/author/renee-knight.html\">Renée Knight</a>","price":"180.000 ₫","description":"Disclaimer"},{"name":"Beasts Of Lympus #1: Beast Keeper","author":null,"price":"104.000 ₫","description":"Beasts Of Lympus #1: Beast Keeper"},{"name":"Emma","author":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/author/jane-austen.html\">Jane Austen</a>","price":"36.000 ₫","description":"Emma"},{"name":"X","author":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/author/sue-grafton.html\">Sue Grafton</a>","price":"165.000 ₫","description":"X"},{"name":"Escape From Mr. Lemoncello's Library","author":null,"price":"121.000 ₫","description":"Escape From Mr. Lemoncello's Library"},{"name":"The Sweet Dead Life","author":null,"price":"190.000 ₫","description":"The Sweet Dead Life"},{"name":"Julie And Julia","author":null,"price":"136.000 ₫","description":"Julie And Julia"},{"name":"Ordinary Thunderstorm","author":null,"price":"136.000 ₫","description":"Ordinary Thunderstorm"},{"name":"Prey: A Novel","author":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/author/linda-howard.html\">Linda Howard</a>","price":"165.000 ₫","description":"Prey: A Novel"},{"name":"The Turn Of The Screw","author":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/author/henry-james.html\">Henry James</a>","price":"45.000 ₫","description":"The Turn Of The Screw"},{"name":"A Study In Scarlett","author":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/author/arthur-conan-doyle.html\">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>","price":"45.000 ₫","description":"A Study In Scarlett"},{"name":"Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them: The Original Screenplay","author":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/author/j-k-rowling.html\">J.
