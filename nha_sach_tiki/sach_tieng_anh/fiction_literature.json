The basic plot is vintage Dickens: an inheritance up for grabs, a murder, a rocky romance or two, plenty of skullduggery, and a host of unforgettable secondary characters. But in this final outing the author's heroes are more flawed, his villains more sympathetic, and the story as a whole more harrowing and less sentimental. The mood is set in the opening scene in which a riverman, Gaffer Hexam, and his daughter Lizzie troll the Thames searching for drowned men whose pockets Gaffer will rifle before turning the body over to the authorities. On this particular night Gaffer finds a corpse that is later identified as that of John Harmon, who was returning from abroad to claim a large fortune when he was apparently murdered and thrown into the river.Harmon's death is the catalyst for everything else that happens in the novel.\r\nIt seems the fortune was left to the young man on the condition that he marry a girl he'd never met, Bella Wilfer. His death, however, brings a new heir onto the scene, Nicodemus Boffin, the kind-hearted but low-born assistant to Harmon's father. Boffin and his wife adopt young Bella, who is determined to marry money, and also hire a mysterious young secretary, John Rokesmith, who takes an uncommon interest in their ward. Not content with just one plot, Dickens throws in a secondary love story featuring the riverman's daughter, Lizzie Hexam; a dissolute young upper-class lawyer, Eugene Wrayburn; and his rival, the headmaster Bradley Headstone. Dark as the novel is, Dickens is careful to leaven it with secondary characters who are as funny as they are menacing--blackmailing Silas Wegg and his accomplice Mr. Venus, the avaricious Lammles, and self-centered Charlie Hexam. Our Mutual Friend is one of Dickens's most satisfying novels, and a fitting denouement to his prolific career.\r\n(Alix Wilber - This text refers to an alternate Paperback edition)","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/o/u/our-mutual-friend.jpg"]},{"name":"King Solomon's Mines & Allan Quatermain","brand":"H.

From the beginning we are locked into the frenzied consciousness of Raskolnikov who, against his better instincts, is inexorably drawn to commit a brutal double murder. From that moment on, we share his conflicting feelings of self-loathing and pride, of contempt for and need of others, and of terrible despair and hope of redemption: and, in a remarkable transformation of the detective novel, we follow his agonised efforts to probe and confront both his own motives for, and the consequences of, his crime. The result is a tragic novel built out of a series of supremely dramatic scenes that illuminate the eternal conflicts at the heart of human existence: most especially our desire for self-expression and self-fulfilment, as against the constraints of morality and human laws; and our agonised awareness of the world's harsh injustices and of our own mortality, as against the mysteries of divine justice and immortality.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/k/h/kho394.u2377.d20160930.t135149.680060.jpg"]},{"name":"Deception Point","brand":null,"price":"164.000 ₫","description":"Deception Point\r\nThe book begins with an enigmatic prologue which promptly sows the seeds of intrigue for the entire read. In the light of the imminent elections, President Zachary isn't looking too good in the public eye. A staunch NASA supporter, he has endorsed a series of NASA's failed missions with the tax payer's money. His nemesis, the manipulative senator Sedgewick Sexton, has used this to his utmost advantage and is basking in the good books of the people, as his intentions of abolishing NASA have been publicized. So when NASA satellites descry a high density meteorite, submerged in the Milne ice shelf and carrying fossils of extraterrestrial bugs, in the midst of this political unrest, the miraculous find seems to be a ploy to secure the incumbent president a second term in the White House. The president personally requests Rachel from the NRO (coincidentally also the estranged daughter of Senator Sexton), to accompany a team of eminent civilian scientists to authenticate NASA's claim. When Michael Tollan, the renowned oceanographer, astrophysicist Corky Marlinson, glaciologist Nora Mangor, paleontologist Wailee Ming, and Rachel Sexton arrive at their destination and examine the fossils, everything seems bona fide and a spirit of victory sets in as the President is informed.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/d/e/deception-point_3.jpg"]},{"name":"A Game Of Thrones","brand":"George R.

Lawrence","price":"60.000 ₫","description":"Sons And Lovers\r\nSons and Lovers was the first modern portrayal of a phenomenon that later, thanks to Freud, became easily recognizable as the Oedipus complex. Never was a son more indentured to his mother's love and full of hatred for his father than Paul Morel, D.H. Lawrence's young protagonist. Never, that is, except perhaps Lawrence himself. In his 1913 novel he grappled with the discordant loves that haunted him all his life--for his spiritual childhood sweetheart, here called Miriam, and for his mother, whom he transformed into Mrs. Morel. It is, by Lawrence's own account, a book aimed at depicting this woman's grasp: \"as her sons grow up she selects them as lovers--first the eldest, then the second. These sons are urged into life by their reciprocal love of their mother--urged on and on. But when they come to manhood, they can't love, because their mother is the strongest power in their lives.\"Of course, Mrs. Morel takes neither of her two elder sons (the first of whom dies early, which further intensifies her grip on Paul) as a literal lover, but nonetheless her psychological snare is immense. She loathes Paul's Miriam from the start, understanding that the girl's deep love of her son will oust her: \"She's not like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him. She wants to absorb him.\" Meanwhile, Paul plays his part with equal fervor, incapable of committing himself in either direction: \"Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?... And why did he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he hated her--and he easily hated her.\" Soon thereafter he even confesses to his mother: \"I really don't love her. I talk to her, but I want to come home to you.\"\r\nThe result of all this is that Paul throws Miriam over for a married suffragette, Clara Dawes, who fulfills the sexual component of his ascent to manhood but leaves him, as ever, without a complete relationship to challenge his love for his mother. As Paul voyages from the working-class mining world to the spheres of commerce and art (he has fair success as a painter), he accepts that his own achievements must be equally his mother's. \"There was so much to come out of him. Life for her was rich with promise. She was to see herself fulfilled...

Frank Bascombe, fifty-five, settled in his realty business in Sea-Clift, New Jersey, has arrived at a state of optimistic pragmatism that he calls the Permanent Period of life. Epic mistakes have already been made; dreams downsized, and Frank reflects that now at least there are fewer opportunities left in life to get things wrong. But the tranquility he had anticipated is not to be.\r\nWho could have guessed that his second wife Sally would walk out on their apparently happy marriage? Or that, after all these years, he would be spending Thanksgiving dinner with first wife Ann and their two children? That Ann might still, after all, feel for him what he has never quite stopped feeling for her?

As the team digs deeper, each of the Kesslers comes under close scrutiny, and in captivity their family bonds are stretched to the breaking point--as the lifter draws near, Corte must ultimately choose between protecting his charges and exposing them to a killer in the name of long-awaited revenge.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51dt3ygxv-l._sx306_bo1,204,203,200_.u547.d20160809.t091657.575045.jpg"]},{"name":"Carte Blanche","brand":"Jeffery Deaver","price":"138.000 ₫","description":"Carte Blanche\r\n'The face of war is changing.

Lockwood, the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange, situated on the bleak Yorkshire moors, is forced to seek shelter one night at Wuthering Heights, the home of his landlord. There he discovers the history of the tempestuous events that took place years before; of the intense relationship between the gypsy foundling Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw; and how Catherine, forced to choose between passionate, tortured Heathcliff and gentle, well-bred Edgar Linton, surrendered to the expectations of her class. As Heathcliff's bitterness and vengeance at his betrayal is visited upon the next generation, their innocent heirs must struggle to escape the legacy of the past. In this edition, a new preface by Lucasta Miller, author of The Brontë Myth, looks at the ways in which the novel has been interpreted, from Charlotte Brontë onwards. This complements Pauline Nestor's introduction, which discusses changing critical receptions of the novel, as well as Emily Brontë's influences and background. Emily Brontë (1818-48), along with her sisters, Charlotte and Anne, was one of the most significant literary figures of the 19th century. She wrote just one strikingly innovative novel, Wuthering Heights, but was also a gifted and intense poet. If you enjoyed Wuthering Heights, you may like Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre, also available in Penguin Classics.
