The backdrop is Brooklyn, Chelsea Hotel, Max's Kansas City, Scribner's Bookstore, Coney Island, Warhol's Factory and the whole city resplendent. Among their friends, literary lights, musicians and artists such as Harry Smith, Bobby Neuwirth, Allen Ginsberg, Sandy Daley, Sam Shepherd, William Burroughs, etc. It was a heightened time politically and culturally; theart and music worlds exploding and colliding.

Much in demand for his ability to make women look and feel fabulous, he regularly travels the world to get clients ready for red-carpet events, photoshoots and television appearances. In Simply Glamorous, Gary proves that with a little knowledge and practice, everyone can use make-up to enhance or disguise so they feel confident in their appearance. He begins by demonstrating what he loves most about make-up: its ability to transform. By applying four different looks to one face, he shows how the same 'blank canvas' can be natural, sophisticated, glamorous or dramatic. He then presents 15 breathtaking makeovers on women of all ages, explaining step by step how to re-create the looks. Divided into 'Face', 'Eyes' and 'Lips', the transformations range from nude and natural - 'Barely There', 'Sun-kissed Goddess' and 'Girl Next Door' - to high octane glamour - 'Showgirl', 'Bombshell' and 'Glamour Puss'. They illustrate every aspect of make-up, from contouring, to false eyelashes, to wearing colour, and include the iconic looks that Gary is always asked to create - the smoky eye, the fifties flick and the red lip. 'Tutorials' address key topics in greater detail, such as skincare, foundation, contouring and application techniques for eyes and lips. As a self-taught make-up artist, Gary works instinctively with amazing results. His approach is creative and painterly, and his teaching style is friendly and down-to-earth as he shows how glamorous make-up can be accessible to everyone. He may not always do things the conventional way, but his techniques are the result of more than 25 years spent working with women and men of all ages, ethnicities and styles. He knows what works and what looks good, and encourages everyone to have fun and experiment with make-up to make themselves look and feel beautiful and glamorous.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/1/8/18.u335.d20160505.t171533.jpg"]},{"name":"Sketching: Drawing Techniques For Product Designers","brand":"Koos Eissen","price":"756.000 ₫","description":"Sketching: Drawing Techniques For Product Designers","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/1/_/1.u335.d20160506.t102540.jpg"]},{"name":"The Coolest Apartments","brand":null,"price":"1.206.000 ₫","description":"The Coolest Apartments","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/3/_/3.u335.d20160506.t103117.jpg"]},{"name":"Top Space And Art IV","brand":"Li Aihong","price":"1.305.000 ₫","description":"Top Space And Art IV\r\nTop Space & Art IV presents examples of where graphic design meets structure and interior design, illustrating venues that have been turned into incredibly eye-catching spaces.

Their disposable nature means that they have to sell quickly, and their covers vie for attention on the shelves with images of beauty, sex, shock, humour and celebrity. This book gathers over 300 of the most striking, provocative and iconic covers from the last 100 years to chart the evolution of a cultural phenomenon.  Covering the period from 1900 to the present day, 100 Years of Magazine Covers is an alternative narrative of an enthralling, tumultuous century. From the nascent movie stars of the 1920s that catalysed the magazine industry and birthed the modern ‘celebrity’ to the catastrophic global conflicts that scarred the globe and were characterised by a massive channelling of creative energy onto the magazine cover, this book is a consummate survey of a medium that refuses to fade away.  100 Years of Magazine Covers presents covers from fashion and women’s magazines such as Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and Harper’s Bazaar; news publications-from the era-defining photo-journalism of Life and Time, through Stern and the rise of the broadsheet supplement; magazines such as Esquire, Heat and The Face that have one way or another influenced entire generations-to the underground punk and counter-culture publications of the 1960s and 1970s, such as Sniffing Glue and Oz. The book also includes seldom seen covers from the Vinmag Archive and more recent developments in magazine design including Dazed & Confused, Tank, Grafik and i-D.

A self-taught artist, by the time of his death in 1965, Dorne had established himself as perhaps the preeminent, highest paid illustrator of his day-one whose services were sought after by the biggest companies and best magazines for his memorable advertizing art and dynamic illustrations. A self-made man, he enjoyed the finest things that his millions could buy, and yet he never forgot his roots and remained a champion of the handicapped and the working man to the end.\r\nNow, for the first time, the entire career of this complex titan of education, industry and illustration is presented in the pages of one book. Featuring an informative essay by David Apatoff, an insightful introduction by author-illustrator Howard Munce, who knew the artist, and a graphic foreword by celebrated Mad magazine artist, Jack Davis, this volume captures the scope and breadth of Albert Dorne's many accomplishments.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/6/1/61iu0pcskil._sx369_bo1,204,203,200_.u547.d20160513.t101615.jpg"]},{"name":"American Graphic Design And Advertising 25 - Hardcover","brand":"David E.

Expressing this proposition in an original, novel, imaginative, memorable, yet relevant fashion is the tricky bit – particularly when it seems that all the best ideas have already been used. Having a great idea is difficult enough. Having great ideas repeatedly, and on a regular basis is the real creative challenge. On many occasions, you may simply feel that you’re out of fresh ideas, or have come up against a creative block. This is where Ideation can help you break through to find creative solutions.\r\nThe book begins by looking at the process of idea generation (ideation) in broad terms; establishing the key principles that are involved, together with a look at what stops us having ideas, and how to get around or avoid those obstacles.

In a world with finite resources and a growing population, design that mimics or appropriates the sustainable template of nature is likely to prove as vital as it is novel. Bio Design examines some seventy projects (concepts, prototypes and completed designs) that cover the fields of architecture, industrial processes, education, fine art, material engineering and bioengineering. Each project is illustrated by a short text, images and captions that combine to explain the problems the venture tackles, and how living materials and processes were harnessed to solve them in sustainable and aesthetically pleasing ways.

Nor is innovation seen as merely technological and ground-breaking; instead, it’s considered to be any value that is brought to the market and that helps users to fulfil a purpose. This book explains how branding can be a driving force for product and service innovations, infusing them with the vision that they need to become relevant, authentic and original. It explores how innovation can help brands fulfil their promise through meaningful manifestations, interactions and experiences, leading to a more durable relationship between organisations and their customers. Crucially, Brand Driven Innovation demonstrates the role that design management can play in connecting the disciplines of branding and innovation, providing the reader with tools, processes and methods to facilitate this relationship. The first part of Brand Driven Innovation explores existing theoretical ideas in branding, innovation and design management in order to provide you with a solid foundation of knowledge about the subject.

The story of the Freeman House, and of the attempt to save it, entails almost all of the provocative issues that make historic preservation as a field so fascinating, technologically and theoretically complex, and politically charged.\r\nSaving Wright chronicles the ongoing struggle to save Wright’s Freeman House in the Hollywood Hills, the setting for fascinating people and events but deeply flawed from the time it was built ninety-five years ago. The Freeman House was an experiment born out of Frank Lloyd Wright’s polemical vision of a new kind of architecture for the middle class, for modern America, and, in particular, for the Los Angeles foothills. Its design and construction were difficult, thus, along with many poor decisions, planting within a beautiful work of architecture the seeds of its own destruction.\r\nJeffrey M. Chusid, who lived in the house and studied it while Harriet Freeman was still alive and residing there and, later, after she gave it to the School of Architecture at the University of Southern California, examines the experimental “textile-block” construction system, the power of Wright’s architecture, the interaction of people and place, and the concepts and challenges of historic preservation―why and how we do it. The Freeman House is a valuable case study because it serves as a test of established preservation procedures and protocols, of building forensics and conservation techniques, and of the meaning of a historic site to overlapping and not necessarily compatible communities.\r\nSaving Wright also received an honorable mention for the 2012 Lee Nelson Book Award from the Association for Preservation Technology, Intl.

Linking these lines that crisscrossed the map were the stations themselves, the very centerpieces―physical and metaphorical―of civic and cultural life in America.\r\nThey were backdrops to commonplace comings and goings as well as public lecturers and evangelists, rallies and wartime troop movement; outposts of Western settlement; staging grounds for presidential whistle-stop tours; and destinations for a new class of tourists that arose at the turn of the twentieth century. Reflecting a vast range of shapes, styles, and sizes, their architectural diversity defined them nearly as much as their hallowed place in American history.\r\nOrganized by region, Railroad Stations: The Buildings That Link the Nation captures all their expressions, from modest to glorious.

Rafiq Azam is a world-renowned architect. He recently received the Residential Building of the Year Award at the 2012 Emirates Glass LEAF Awards, which took place during the 2012 London Design Festival. He has a holistic approach to design, which not only incorporates the elements of nature but also harnesses its beauty and potential in a practical way in order to enhance the personal experience of a building. From his uniquely Bangladeshi perspective, the human form has two parts—the body as shell and thoughts as soul—and his architecture is similar, where the building manifests as the shell and nature as its soul. Considering the socioeconomic and city-planning conditions of Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital,\r\nAzam’s architectural vocabulary is kept simple and essential, with traditional spaces like the courtyard, pond, and ghat (steps leading into water) and ample internal and external greenery that merge both urban and rural typologies in an intensely urban context. He arranges water courts as swimming ponds in the middle of homes, natural light rooms, and unfolding wall systems to emphasize the interrelationship between form and space.

Recognizable human and animal shapes are an important source of inspiration in Mandersloot's work, mainly serving as a metaphor. Rabbits, donkeys, dogs, and bears are formed in a humorous response to the malleable world of this moment. Every sculpture seems to possess a fabulous acting talent—body poses and material expression are used to create unique characters which often elicit poignant emotions in onlookers. The omission of detail, expanding proportions, or the focus on specific parts of the sculpture leads to a pleasant confusion and often even a smile.\r\nAmbiguity suppresses narrative recognition and invites a new interpretation, with the sculptures' surprising tactility inviting viewers to explore the borders between imagination and reality. This new book of Mandersloot's work presents her latest projects, including her recent collaborations with the luxury fashion house Hermès of Paris.\r\nIn the artistic imagination of Marjolijn Mandersloot, perfection does not seem to be a high priority. Her animal and human figures are an example of imperfection. The prevailing ideal of physical beauty inspires her to constantly examine this world of cute creatures.

His work first garnered attention in the 1990s when he ushered in a new genre of painting, \"Pop Surrealism,\" dragging a host of followers in his wake. He has trumped the initial surrealist strategies by choosing subject matter loaded with cultural connotation.Ryden’s vocabulary ranges from cryptic to cute, treading a fine line between nostalgic cliché and disturbing archetype. Seduced by his infinitely detailed and meticulously glazed surfaces, the viewer is confronted with the juxtaposition of the childhood innocence and the mysterious recesses of the soul. A subtle disquiet inhabits his paintings; the work is achingly beautiful as it hints at darker psychic stuff beneath the surface of cultural kitsch. In Ryden’s world cherubic girls rub elbows with strange and mysterious figures. Ornately carved frames lend the paintings a baroque exuberance that adds gravity to their enigmatic themes. Complex in its arcane and idiosyncratic subject matter, Ryden’s work can leave no viewer unmoved.Pinxit, whose title refers to the Latin term meaning \"painted by,\" is organized by the themes of Ryden’s major exhibitions—The Meat Show, Bunnies & Bees, The Tree Show, and so on—and includes collected essays by Yoshitomo Nara, Carlo McCormick, and others, and a new essay by culture critic Kristine McKenna.

Castiglioni's work is celebrated for its combination of technical innovation with an aesthetically-pleasing form, as demonstrated in his elegant Luminator floor lamp for Gilardi & Barzaghi (1955) and the distinctive Frisbi hanging light for Flos (1978). His designs also demonstrated wit - the 'readymade' furniture designs created with Pier Giacomo in 1957 incorporated tractor and bicycle seats into new stools. He created hundreds of pieces of furniture, lighting and products for a distinguished client list including Kartell, Knoll, Zanotta, Alessi and Siemens.

Knapp traveled throughout Southeast Asia, searching out homes built by the first generations of successful Chinese settlers during the late eighteenth to the early twentieth century. In Chinese Houses of Southeast Asia, Knapp presents an eye-opening account of how Chinese migration into Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam spawned a unique hybrid architectural style that combined Chinese, European, and local influences.Many of these overseas Chinese heritage homes are disappearing, but Knapp—along with renowned photographer A. Chester Ong—visited a number of the shophouses, bungalows, villas, and mansions that remain.More than three dozen of these elegant residences form the core of this book, and through essays, historic photographs, paintings, and line drawings, Knapp draws an illuminating portrait of each residence along with background information about the families who built and lived in them. These profiles reveal the entrepreneurial spirit of the Chinese as well as their social and economic circumstances. A stunning marriage of scholarship and photography, Chinese Houses of Southeast Asia explores a little known branch of Chinese architecture and provides a new perspective on Chinese migration, settlement, and identity in Southeast Asia.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/6/1/61+ochjm2al._sx377_bo1,204,203,200_.u2487.d20160514.t114342.jpg"]},{"name":"Discovering The Best Hotels - Hardcover","brand":"Huang Dan","price":"3.375.000 ₫","description":"Discovering The Best Hotels","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/3/1/31kaghias8l._bo1,204,203,200_.u2487.d20160514.t143924.jpg"]},{"name":"AIA 2010 - 2012: Designs for the New Decade - Hardcover","brand":"Design Media Publishing Limited","price":"929.500 ₫","description":"AIA 2010 - 2012: Designs for the New Decade\r\nIn the book, the AIA recognizes three years worth of award recipients across four categories: architecture, interior architecture, regional, and urban design, and its esteemed Twenty-Five Year Award.

Like one of Masuno's gardens, the book can be a place for contemplation and mindful repose.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/516n5kmi9fl._sx450_bo1,204,203,200_.u2469.d20160514.t165939.jpg"]},{"name":"Brick - Hardcover","brand":"William Hall","price":"927.000 ₫","description":"Brick\r\nBrick is a fresh, insightful and surprising look at one of the world’s most familiar and popular building materials.

While called 25 Tropical Houses in Singapore and Malaysia, this book is at its heart about buildings that share a common spirit: structures that are home to a diverse cross-section of families around Singapore and Malaysia.Positioned as a global city at the hub of South East Asia, Singapore has a thoroughly modern sensibility balanced by an inherited culture and sense of place. This new global consciousness is reflected in its architecture, which demonstrates a seamless marriage of vernacular and modernist forms. The luxury homes in this book illustrate how architects work with, rather than against, the singular landscape to generate beautiful tropical homes embellished with modern Asian decor. A new wave of highly distinctive architecture has seen Singapore recognized, for the first time, as one of the world's most dynamic architectural centers.Malaysian architecture retains a greater interest in vernacular forms, but the nation's strong economic growth has seen a push to recast the urban landscape. Architects are now working to accommodate the 'brave new world' of an affluent technocratic society within the Asian architecture vernacular currently found throughout most of the country. The most interesting new homes in Malaysia reflect a balance between traditional values and an optimistic global outlook.25 Tropical Houses in Singapore and Malaysia is an amazing source of home inspiration and insights, whether one seeks to know more about Singapore architecture, Malaysian traditions or tropical architecture in general.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51mp+tpjxjl._sx370_bo1,204,203,200_.u2487.d20160513.t094111.jpg"]},{"name":"2012 Architect Competiton Annual 7 - Paperback","brand":"Archiworld","price":"630.000 ₫","description":"2012 Architect Competiton Annual 7","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/4/1/41audbipfrl._sx331_bo1,204,203,200_.u2469.d20160514.t161900.jpg"]},{"name":"25 Tropical Houses In Singapore And Malaysia","brand":null,"price":"918.000 ₫","description":"25 Tropical Houses In Singapore And Malaysia","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/9/7/978079460528525.u383.d20160517.t162143.jpg","https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/t/i/tiki_19.u547.d20160510.t082048_2_1_1_2_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_2_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1.jpg"]},{"name":"The Tropical House - Hardcover","brand":"Elizabeth Reyes","price":"910.000 ₫","description":"The Tropical House\r\nTropical House celebrates a growing trend toward stylish globalization in interior design.\r\nMore than 25 stunning houses and condos in and around Manila, the Philippines, evoke a distinctive tropical-modern-fusion style that is gaining popularity around the world.

Architecture seems entrenched: naively utopian or petrifyingly pragmatic. We believe there is a third way between these diametric opposites: a pragmatic utopian architecture that creates socially, economically and environmentally perfect places as a practical objective.
