Texts such as 'Could you live without money?' really help to generate opinion and discussion.\r\nThey create a desire to communicate.\r\nHaving created the desire, American English File then helps you to develop learners' communication skills. One way it does this is with a strong focus on pronunciation.\r\nResearch shows that poor pronunciation is a major contributor to breakdowns in communication (Jennifer Jenkins: The Phonology of English as an International Language).\r\nAmerican English File integrates pronunciation into every lesson - the 'little and often' approach. But that's not all.\r\nThe unique English File Sounds Chart puts a picture to each sound in the phonetic alphabet, so learners find it easier to remember the sounds and, ultimately, improve their pronunciation.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/518cyyzxg5l-_sx394_bo1-204-203-200_.u2469.d20161007.t140241.794875.jpg"]},{"name":"Our Discovery Island (Ame Ed.) 6: Value Pack","brand":null,"price":"236.000 ₫","description":"Our Discovery Island (Ame Ed.) 6: Value Pack","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/i/m/img822.u335.d20161025.t104011.793790.jpg"]},{"name":"Gateway B1: Work Book","brand":"David Spencer","price":"122.000 ₫","description":"Gateway B1: Work Book\r\nGateway is an academically-rich five-level course designed to lead teenage students to success in school-leaving and university entrance exams and prepare them for university and the world of work.
