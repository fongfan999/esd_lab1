Circuits that interface with the physical environment need to be able to process these signals. Principles of Analog Electronics introduces the fascinating world of analog electronics, where fields, circuits, signals and systems, and semiconductors meet. Drawing on the author’s teaching experience, this richly illustrated, full-color textbook expertly blends theory with practical examples to give a clear understanding of how real electronic circuits work. Build from the Essentials of Math, Physics, and Chemistry to Electronic Components, Circuits, and Applications Building a solid foundation, the book first explains the mathematics, physics, and chemistry that are essential for grasping the principles behind the operation of electronic devices. It then examines the theory of circuits through models and important theorems. The book describes and analyzes passive and active electronic devices, focusing on fundamental filters and common silicon-based components, including diodes, bipolar junction transistors, and metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). It also shows how semiconductor devices are used to design electronic circuits such as rectifiers, power suppliers, clamper and clipper circuits, and amplifiers. A chapter explores actual applications, from audio amplifiers and FM radios to battery chargers. Delve Deeper into Analog Electronics through Curiosities, Key Personalities, and Practical Examples Each chapter includes helpful summaries with key points, jargon, and terms, as well as exercises to test your knowledge. Practical tables illustrate the coding schemes to help identify commercial passive and active components. Throughout, sidebars highlight curiosities, interesting observations, and examples that make the subject more concrete. This textbook offers a truly comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of analog electronics, including essential background concepts. Taking a fresh approach, it connects electronics to its importance in daily life, from music to medicine and more.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781466582019.u2469.d20160726.t163412.jpg"]},{"name":"My First English Adventure 2: Activity Book - Paperback","brand":"Mady Musiol - Magaly Villarroel","price":"136.000 ₫","description":"My First English Adventure 2: Activity Book\r\nIn the Activity Book:\r\n- Activities and games reinforce the basic language presented in the main units.\r\n- A wide range of activities appeal to a range of learning styles and enable vocabulary practice.\r\nChildren can practise what they have learnt.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51axhz0acal._sx359_bo1,204,203,200_.u547.d20160616.t164123.jpg"]},{"name":"Oxford Learner's Pocket Grammar: Pocket-sized Grammar To Revise And Check Grammar Rules","brand":"John Eastwood","price":"93.000 ₫","description":"Oxford Learner's Pocket Grammar: Pocket-sized Grammar to Revise and Check Grammar Rules\r\nEach of the 180 grammar topics is organized into 2-page sections Explains how the grammar for each topic is used and how to avoid mistakes Includes a tip to help students sound more natural Covers the topics students need to know for the Cambridge ESOL exams (FCE, CAE and CPE).","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/o/x/oxford-learner_s-pocket-grammar.jpg"]}]
