Leon Leyson (born Leib Lezjon) was only ten years old when the Nazis invaded Poland and his family was forced to relocate to the Krakow ghetto. With incredible luck, perseverance, and grit, Leyson was able to survive the sadism of the Nazis, including that of the demonic Amon Goeth, commandant of Plaszow, the concentration camp outside Krakow.Ultimately, it was the generosity and cunning of one man, Oskar Schindler, who saved Leon Leyson’s life, and the lives of his mother, his father, and two of his four siblings, by adding their names to his list of workers in his factory-a list that became world renowned: Schindler’s list.Told with an abundance of dignity and a remarkable lack of rancor and venom, The Boy on the Wooden Box is a legacy of hope, a memoir unlike anything you’ve ever read.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51atzgl6vnl._sx334_bo1,204,203,200_.u547.d20160808.t084655.272970.jpg"]},{"name":"The Going To Bed Book","brand":"Sandra Boynton","price":"138.000 ₫","description":"The Going To Bed Book\r\nGetting ready for sleep is tons of fun in this special anniversary edition of a Sandra Boynton classic.\r\nThe sun has set not long ago.\r\nNow everybody goes below\r\nto take a bath in one big tub\r\nwith soap all over-SCRUB SCRUB SCRUB!\r\nThis classic bedtime story is just right for winding down the day as a joyful, silly group of animals scrub scrub scrub in the tub, brush and brush and brush their teeth, and finally rock and rock and rock to sleep.\r\nThis anniversary edition has an enlarged trim size and metallic ink on the cover, making this Boynton classic even more special.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/519bicixhil._sx496_bo1,204,203,200_.u547.d20160808.t085100.348547.jpg"]},{"name":"Where Are Baby's Easter Eggs?","brand":"Karen Katz","price":"138.000 ₫","description":"Where Are Baby's Easter Eggs?\r\nLittle ones will love lifting the large, sturdy flaps in this sweet, irresistible board book to find Baby's Easter eggs from Karen Katz.\r\nWhere could the Easter eggs be?

Get What’s Yours has been revised and updated to reflect new regulations that took effect on April 29, 2016.\r\nGet What’s Yours has proven itself to be the definitive book about how to navigate the forbidding maze of Social Security and emerge with the highest possible benefits. It is an engaging manual of tactics and strategies written by well-known financial commentators that is unobtainable elsewhere. You could try reading all 2,728 rules of the Social Security system (and the thousands of explanations of these rules), but academia’s Kotlikoff, the popular press’s Moeller, and public television’s Solman explain the Social Security system just as comprehensively, and a lot more comprehensibly. Moreover, they demonstrate that what you don’t know can seriously hurt you: wrong decisions about which Social Security benefits to apply for cost individual retirees tens of thousands of dollars in lost income every year. (Some of those people are even in the book.)\r\nChanges to Social Security that take effect in 2016 make it more important than ever to wait as long as possible (until age 70, if possible) to claim Social Security benefits. The new law also has significant implications for those who wish to claim divorced spousal benefits (and how many Social Security recipients even know about divorced spousal benefits?). Besides addressing these and other issues, this revised edition contains a chapter explaining how Medicare rules can shape Social Security decisions.\r\nMany other personal-finance books briefly address Social Security, but none offers the full, authoritative, yet conversational analysis of Get What’s Yours.\r\nGet What’s Yours explains Social Security benefits through basic strategies and stirring stories. It covers the most frequent benefit scenarios faced by married retired couples; by divorced retirees; by widows and widowers. It explains what to do if you’re a retired parent of dependent children; disabled; an eligible beneficiary who continues to work. It addresses the tax consequences of your choices, as well as the financial implications for other investments. It does all this and more.\r\nThere are more than 52 million Americans aged 54 to 69. Ten thousand of them reach Social Security’s full retirement age of 66 every day. For all these people-and for their families and friends-Get What’s Yours has proven to be an invaluable, and therefore indispensable, tool.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51ld6r290xl._sx332_bo1,204,203,200_.u547.d20160808.t150422.236817.jpg"]},{"name":"Bear Hugs!","brand":"Andrea Posner-Sanchez - Random House","price":"86.000 ₫","description":"Bear Hugs!\r\nWorry Bear loves hugs-getting them and giving them!
