One of his first cases was that of Walter McMillian, a young man who was sentenced to die for a notorious murder he insisted he didn’t commit. The case drew Bryan into a tangle of conspiracy, political machination, and legal brinksmanship-and transformed his understanding of mercy and justice forever.\r\nJust Mercy is at once an unforgettable account of an idealistic, gifted young lawyer’s coming of age, a moving window into the lives of those he has defended, and an inspiring argument for compassion in the pursuit of true justice.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/518q+hqvqkl._sx322_bo1,204,203,200_.u547.d20160920.t153001.665950.jpg"]},{"name":"Next Move 2: Student Book With DVD-ROM - Paperback","brand":"Amanda Cant - Mary Charrington","price":"135.000 ₫","description":"Next Move 2: Student Book With DVD-ROM\r\nNext Move is an innovative, seven-level print and digital series in American English.
