After thirty years, Wilson Lewis is forced to face a painful truth: the romance has gone out of his marriage. His wife, Jane, has fallen out of love with him, and it is entirely his fault. Despite the shining example of his in-laws, Noah and Allie Calhoun, and their fifty-year love affair (originally recounted in The Notebook), Wilson himself is a man unable to express his true feelings. He has spent too little time at home and too much at the office, leaving the responsibility of raising their children to Jane. Now his daughter is about to marry, and his wife is thinking about leaving him. But if Wilson is sure of anything, it is this: His love for Jane has only grown over the years, and he will do everything he can to save their marriage. With the memories of Noah and Allie's inspiring life together as his guide, he vows to find a way to make his wife fall in love with him...all over again.

To punish citizens for an early rebellion, the rulers require each district to provide one girl and one boy, 24 in all, to fight like gladiators in a futuristic arena.

The basic plot is vintage Dickens: an inheritance up for grabs, a murder, a rocky romance or two, plenty of skullduggery, and a host of unforgettable secondary characters. But in this final outing the author's heroes are more flawed, his villains more sympathetic, and the story as a whole more harrowing and less sentimental. The mood is set in the opening scene in which a riverman, Gaffer Hexam, and his daughter Lizzie troll the Thames searching for drowned men whose pockets Gaffer will rifle before turning the body over to the authorities. On this particular night Gaffer finds a corpse that is later identified as that of John Harmon, who was returning from abroad to claim a large fortune when he was apparently murdered and thrown into the river.Harmon's death is the catalyst for everything else that happens in the novel.\r\nIt seems the fortune was left to the young man on the condition that he marry a girl he'd never met, Bella Wilfer. His death, however, brings a new heir onto the scene, Nicodemus Boffin, the kind-hearted but low-born assistant to Harmon's father. Boffin and his wife adopt young Bella, who is determined to marry money, and also hire a mysterious young secretary, John Rokesmith, who takes an uncommon interest in their ward. Not content with just one plot, Dickens throws in a secondary love story featuring the riverman's daughter, Lizzie Hexam; a dissolute young upper-class lawyer, Eugene Wrayburn; and his rival, the headmaster Bradley Headstone. Dark as the novel is, Dickens is careful to leaven it with secondary characters who are as funny as they are menacing--blackmailing Silas Wegg and his accomplice Mr. Venus, the avaricious Lammles, and self-centered Charlie Hexam. Our Mutual Friend is one of Dickens's most satisfying novels, and a fitting denouement to his prolific career.\r\n(Alix Wilber - This text refers to an alternate Paperback edition)","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/o/u/our-mutual-friend.jpg"]},{"name":"King Solomon's Mines & Allan Quatermain","brand":"H.

Lawrence","price":"60.000 ₫","description":"Sons And Lovers\r\nSons and Lovers was the first modern portrayal of a phenomenon that later, thanks to Freud, became easily recognizable as the Oedipus complex. Never was a son more indentured to his mother's love and full of hatred for his father than Paul Morel, D.H. Lawrence's young protagonist. Never, that is, except perhaps Lawrence himself. In his 1913 novel he grappled with the discordant loves that haunted him all his life--for his spiritual childhood sweetheart, here called Miriam, and for his mother, whom he transformed into Mrs. Morel. It is, by Lawrence's own account, a book aimed at depicting this woman's grasp: \"as her sons grow up she selects them as lovers--first the eldest, then the second. These sons are urged into life by their reciprocal love of their mother--urged on and on. But when they come to manhood, they can't love, because their mother is the strongest power in their lives.\"Of course, Mrs. Morel takes neither of her two elder sons (the first of whom dies early, which further intensifies her grip on Paul) as a literal lover, but nonetheless her psychological snare is immense. She loathes Paul's Miriam from the start, understanding that the girl's deep love of her son will oust her: \"She's not like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him. She wants to absorb him.\" Meanwhile, Paul plays his part with equal fervor, incapable of committing himself in either direction: \"Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?... And why did he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he hated her--and he easily hated her.\" Soon thereafter he even confesses to his mother: \"I really don't love her. I talk to her, but I want to come home to you.\"\r\nThe result of all this is that Paul throws Miriam over for a married suffragette, Clara Dawes, who fulfills the sexual component of his ascent to manhood but leaves him, as ever, without a complete relationship to challenge his love for his mother. As Paul voyages from the working-class mining world to the spheres of commerce and art (he has fair success as a painter), he accepts that his own achievements must be equally his mother's. \"There was so much to come out of him. Life for her was rich with promise. She was to see herself fulfilled...

It will challenge you to think about the way you treat others, the decisions you make in pursuit of happiness, and your place in the world.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/h/o/how adam smith can change your life.u2673.d20160707.t095034.jpg"]},{"name":"Victorians","brand":null,"price":"157.000 ₫","description":"Victorians","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/l/o/logo_website_tiki.vn.u335.d20160413.t161148_1.png"]},{"name":"How to Play The Recorder","brand":null,"price":"179.000 ₫","description":"How to Play The Recorder\r\nLearn how to play the recorder with this colourful step-by-step guide\r\nHow to Play the Recorder is a highly visual and user-friendly guide for anyone learning to play the recorder on their own, but also a perfect companion to recorder lessons.\r\nFrom the very basics of music to more challenging music and playing duets How to Play the Recorderis the perfect companion for anyone learning how to play the recorder.

Much in demand for his ability to make women look and feel fabulous, he regularly travels the world to get clients ready for red-carpet events, photoshoots and television appearances. In Simply Glamorous, Gary proves that with a little knowledge and practice, everyone can use make-up to enhance or disguise so they feel confident in their appearance. He begins by demonstrating what he loves most about make-up: its ability to transform. By applying four different looks to one face, he shows how the same 'blank canvas' can be natural, sophisticated, glamorous or dramatic. He then presents 15 breathtaking makeovers on women of all ages, explaining step by step how to re-create the looks. Divided into 'Face', 'Eyes' and 'Lips', the transformations range from nude and natural - 'Barely There', 'Sun-kissed Goddess' and 'Girl Next Door' - to high octane glamour - 'Showgirl', 'Bombshell' and 'Glamour Puss'. They illustrate every aspect of make-up, from contouring, to false eyelashes, to wearing colour, and include the iconic looks that Gary is always asked to create - the smoky eye, the fifties flick and the red lip. 'Tutorials' address key topics in greater detail, such as skincare, foundation, contouring and application techniques for eyes and lips. As a self-taught make-up artist, Gary works instinctively with amazing results. His approach is creative and painterly, and his teaching style is friendly and down-to-earth as he shows how glamorous make-up can be accessible to everyone. He may not always do things the conventional way, but his techniques are the result of more than 25 years spent working with women and men of all ages, ethnicities and styles. He knows what works and what looks good, and encourages everyone to have fun and experiment with make-up to make themselves look and feel beautiful and glamorous.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/1/8/18.u335.d20160505.t171533.jpg"]},{"name":"Sketching: Drawing Techniques For Product Designers","brand":"Koos Eissen","price":"756.000 ₫","description":"Sketching: Drawing Techniques For Product Designers","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/1/_/1.u335.d20160506.t102540.jpg"]},{"name":"The Coolest Apartments","brand":null,"price":"1.206.000 ₫","description":"The Coolest Apartments","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/3/_/3.u335.d20160506.t103117.jpg"]},{"name":"Top Space And Art IV","brand":"Li Aihong","price":"1.305.000 ₫","description":"Top Space And Art IV\r\nTop Space & Art IV presents examples of where graphic design meets structure and interior design, illustrating venues that have been turned into incredibly eye-catching spaces.

Their disposable nature means that they have to sell quickly, and their covers vie for attention on the shelves with images of beauty, sex, shock, humour and celebrity. This book gathers over 300 of the most striking, provocative and iconic covers from the last 100 years to chart the evolution of a cultural phenomenon.  Covering the period from 1900 to the present day, 100 Years of Magazine Covers is an alternative narrative of an enthralling, tumultuous century. From the nascent movie stars of the 1920s that catalysed the magazine industry and birthed the modern ‘celebrity’ to the catastrophic global conflicts that scarred the globe and were characterised by a massive channelling of creative energy onto the magazine cover, this book is a consummate survey of a medium that refuses to fade away.  100 Years of Magazine Covers presents covers from fashion and women’s magazines such as Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and Harper’s Bazaar; news publications-from the era-defining photo-journalism of Life and Time, through Stern and the rise of the broadsheet supplement; magazines such as Esquire, Heat and The Face that have one way or another influenced entire generations-to the underground punk and counter-culture publications of the 1960s and 1970s, such as Sniffing Glue and Oz. The book also includes seldom seen covers from the Vinmag Archive and more recent developments in magazine design including Dazed & Confused, Tank, Grafik and i-D.

Expressing this proposition in an original, novel, imaginative, memorable, yet relevant fashion is the tricky bit – particularly when it seems that all the best ideas have already been used. Having a great idea is difficult enough. Having great ideas repeatedly, and on a regular basis is the real creative challenge. On many occasions, you may simply feel that you’re out of fresh ideas, or have come up against a creative block. This is where Ideation can help you break through to find creative solutions.\r\nThe book begins by looking at the process of idea generation (ideation) in broad terms; establishing the key principles that are involved, together with a look at what stops us having ideas, and how to get around or avoid those obstacles. It proceeds to outline various tools and specific techniques for stimulating creativity and having ideas as well as a range of different styles of approach and execution available to the creative team.\r\nThroughout the book, various case studies illustrate the content and provide some valuable insights into the development of creative concepts. Student exercises promote a deeper understanding of the ideation process and help the reader to hone his or her ideation skills.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/4/1/41lvysdcqzl._sx346_bo1,204,203,200_.u547.d20160513.t111028.jpg"]},{"name":"Barnbrook Bible - Hardcover","brand":"Jonathan Barnbrook","price":"720.000 ₫","description":"Barnbrook Bible \r\nJonathan Barnbrook is one of the best-known and most highly regarded graphic designers in the world.

In a world with finite resources and a growing population, design that mimics or appropriates the sustainable template of nature is likely to prove as vital as it is novel. Bio Design examines some seventy projects (concepts, prototypes and completed designs) that cover the fields of architecture, industrial processes, education, fine art, material engineering and bioengineering. Each project is illustrated by a short text, images and captions that combine to explain the problems the venture tackles, and how living materials and processes were harnessed to solve them in sustainable and aesthetically pleasing ways. Many of the solutions also provoke thought about manipulating life for human ends.

Nor is innovation seen as merely technological and ground-breaking; instead, it’s considered to be any value that is brought to the market and that helps users to fulfil a purpose. This book explains how branding can be a driving force for product and service innovations, infusing them with the vision that they need to become relevant, authentic and original. It explores how innovation can help brands fulfil their promise through meaningful manifestations, interactions and experiences, leading to a more durable relationship between organisations and their customers. Crucially, Brand Driven Innovation demonstrates the role that design management can play in connecting the disciplines of branding and innovation, providing the reader with tools, processes and methods to facilitate this relationship. The first part of Brand Driven Innovation explores existing theoretical ideas in branding, innovation and design management in order to provide you with a solid foundation of knowledge about the subject. In the second, practical half of the book, a four step method is demonstrated that will help you to apply BDI in your own academic or business context. The book employs practical examples, case studies and interviews from leading individuals and companies throughout, to provide a practical field guide for both students and practitioners alike.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51q7o-gc-bl._sx368_bo1,204,203,200_.u547.d20160513.t161056.jpg"]},{"name":"Business Layout Top 500 - II","brand":null,"price":"2.430.000 ₫","description":"Business Layout Top 500 - II","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/d/o/download (54).u383.d20160518.t151140.jpg","https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/t/i/tiki_19.u547.d20160510.t082048_2_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_2_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1.jpg"]},{"name":"Calendar Collections - Hardcover","brand":null,"price":"1.260.000 ₫","description":"Calendar Collections","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/4/1/41inp8lfv-l._sy356_bo1,204,203,200_.u547.d20160513.t163019.jpg"]},{"name":"C'est la Vie! - Hardcover","brand":null,"price":"927.000 ₫","description":"C'est la Vie! \r\nThe most extensive collection of cartoons by one of the world’s best‐loved illustrators, Jean‐Jacques Sempé.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51xlvgomttl._sx328_bo1,204,203,200_.u547.d20160513.t164841.jpg"]},{"name":"Cover Art By - Paperback","brand":"Adrian Shaughnessy","price":"675.000 ₫","description":"Cover Art By \r\nThe album cover is a subject of perennial interest among graphic designers.

Place is formed through the feelings of those who visit it. Those feelings are at once \"expectation\", \"impression\" and \"memory\".

A dialogue with the expectations, impressions and memories of visitors. Going beyond space and times, carefully considering the past, pondering the future.\r\nWe call this thinking Space Composition - the experience of pulling together the elements of a place, giving them expression and elevating them to the level of consciousness.

As an elemental part of our landscape and our history, barns evoke childhood memories for many of us, recollections of a simpler way of life. Regardless of their size or shape, their forms follow their functions. They are honest. They are beautiful. And they are rapidly vanishing. Across the land we see abandoned farms with barns falling down, being torn down, and only occasionally being converted to other uses.\r\nAs urban sprawl eats up the countryside and food-producing Goliaths put small farmers out of business, the need for old barns has diminished. For most of his life as a photographer, David Plowden has admired and photographed barns. In recent years, as their disappearance accelerated, he made it his mission to document these beautiful structures, before they too are lost.

The story of the Freeman House, and of the attempt to save it, entails almost all of the provocative issues that make historic preservation as a field so fascinating, technologically and theoretically complex, and politically charged.\r\nSaving Wright chronicles the ongoing struggle to save Wright’s Freeman House in the Hollywood Hills, the setting for fascinating people and events but deeply flawed from the time it was built ninety-five years ago. The Freeman House was an experiment born out of Frank Lloyd Wright’s polemical vision of a new kind of architecture for the middle class, for modern America, and, in particular, for the Los Angeles foothills. Its design and construction were difficult, thus, along with many poor decisions, planting within a beautiful work of architecture the seeds of its own destruction.\r\nJeffrey M. Chusid, who lived in the house and studied it while Harriet Freeman was still alive and residing there and, later, after she gave it to the School of Architecture at the University of Southern California, examines the experimental “textile-block” construction system, the power of Wright’s architecture, the interaction of people and place, and the concepts and challenges of historic preservation―why and how we do it. The Freeman House is a valuable case study because it serves as a test of established preservation procedures and protocols, of building forensics and conservation techniques, and of the meaning of a historic site to overlapping and not necessarily compatible communities.\r\nSaving Wright also received an honorable mention for the 2012 Lee Nelson Book Award from the Association for Preservation Technology, Intl.

Also showcased are related features such as waiting rooms and concourses, some with lavish displays of artwork; elegant details including cornices, cupolas, campaniles, and clock towers; adjacent train sheds and hotels; carriage shops and roadhouses; baggage carts; and much, much more.\r\nIn over 600 striking archival plans, drawings, maps, and images―many from panoramic and aerial perspectives, and taken by such noted photographers as Jack Boucher, Jack Delano, and Jet Lowe―the stories of railroad stations big and small are charted, a visual feast of images chronicling the history and stylistic character of one of our nation’s most iconic building types.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51amtquls9l._sx384_bo1,204,203,200_.u2469.d20160513.t083209.jpg"]},{"name":"Rafiq Azam: Architecture for Green Living - Hardcover","brand":"Rafiq Azam - Rosa Maria Falvo - Kerry Hill - Kazi Khaled Ashraf - Philip Goad - Syed Manzoorul Islam","price":"1.827.000 ₫","description":"Rafiq Azam: Architecture for Green Living\r\nThe first ever monograph on contemporary architectural practice in Bangladesh, dedicated to international-award-winning architect Mohammad Rafiq Azam. Rafiq Azam is a world-renowned architect. He recently received the Residential Building of the Year Award at the 2012 Emirates Glass LEAF Awards, which took place during the 2012 London Design Festival. He has a holistic approach to design, which not only incorporates the elements of nature but also harnesses its beauty and potential in a practical way in order to enhance the personal experience of a building. From his uniquely Bangladeshi perspective, the human form has two parts—the body as shell and thoughts as soul—and his architecture is similar, where the building manifests as the shell and nature as its soul. Considering the socioeconomic and city-planning conditions of Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital,\r\nAzam’s architectural vocabulary is kept simple and essential, with traditional spaces like the courtyard, pond, and ghat (steps leading into water) and ample internal and external greenery that merge both urban and rural typologies in an intensely urban context. He arranges water courts as swimming ponds in the middle of homes, natural light rooms, and unfolding wall systems to emphasize the interrelationship between form and space. With more than 200 color and black-and-white plates, exquisite design sketches, and aerial views, as well as watercolor paintings and inspirational phrases, this exceptionally beautiful book is a unique introduction and insight into a visionary architect and Bangladeshi contemporary living and culture.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/4/1/41qj+a+1oil._sx415_bo1,204,203,200_.u2469.d20160513.t091342.jpg"]},{"name":"Public Square Landscapes - Hardcover","brand":"Arthur Gao","price":"770.000 ₫","description":"Public Square Landscapes\r\nThis title focus on the great projects of the landscape design round the public square all over the world.

Recognizable human and animal shapes are an important source of inspiration in Mandersloot's work, mainly serving as a metaphor. Rabbits, donkeys, dogs, and bears are formed in a humorous response to the malleable world of this moment. Every sculpture seems to possess a fabulous acting talent—body poses and material expression are used to create unique characters which often elicit poignant emotions in onlookers. The omission of detail, expanding proportions, or the focus on specific parts of the sculpture leads to a pleasant confusion and often even a smile.\r\nAmbiguity suppresses narrative recognition and invites a new interpretation, with the sculptures' surprising tactility inviting viewers to explore the borders between imagination and reality.

Her animal and human figures are an example of imperfection. The prevailing ideal of physical beauty inspires her to constantly examine this world of cute creatures.

His work first garnered attention in the 1990s when he ushered in a new genre of painting, \"Pop Surrealism,\" dragging a host of followers in his wake. He has trumped the initial surrealist strategies by choosing subject matter loaded with cultural connotation.Ryden’s vocabulary ranges from cryptic to cute, treading a fine line between nostalgic cliché and disturbing archetype. Seduced by his infinitely detailed and meticulously glazed surfaces, the viewer is confronted with the juxtaposition of the childhood innocence and the mysterious recesses of the soul. A subtle disquiet inhabits his paintings; the work is achingly beautiful as it hints at darker psychic stuff beneath the surface of cultural kitsch. In Ryden’s world cherubic girls rub elbows with strange and mysterious figures. Ornately carved frames lend the paintings a baroque exuberance that adds gravity to their enigmatic themes. Complex in its arcane and idiosyncratic subject matter, Ryden’s work can leave no viewer unmoved.Pinxit, whose title refers to the Latin term meaning \"painted by,\" is organized by the themes of Ryden’s major exhibitions—The Meat Show, Bunnies & Bees, The Tree Show, and so on—and includes collected essays by Yoshitomo Nara, Carlo McCormick, and others, and a new essay by culture critic Kristine McKenna.

The illustrations create a rollicking visual ride while the accompanying text by turns witty and weighty shows how these potent, sometimes charged symbols have even changed the course of world history.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/6/1/61d-tzlcmal._sy498_bo1,204,203,200_.u2487.d20160512.t140049.jpg"]},{"name":"John Mcaslan - Paperback","brand":"Kenneth Powell - Martin Pawley","price":"630.000 ₫","description":"John Mcaslan\r\nA monograph of one of Britain's most internationally acclaimed architects.

This comprehensive monograph is the only detailed study of his remarkable career and includes a catalogue of his complete works from 1938 - 2000 spanning architecture and exhibition, interior and product design. An essay by Sergio Polano describes Castiglioni's important collaborations with his brothers Livio and Pier Giacomo and discusses his diverse range of projects including the spatial design work that dominated his early career as well as his later, better known product designs. Castiglioni's work is celebrated for its combination of technical innovation with an aesthetically-pleasing form, as demonstrated in his elegant Luminator floor lamp for Gilardi & Barzaghi (1955) and the distinctive Frisbi hanging light for Flos (1978). His designs also demonstrated wit - the 'readymade' furniture designs created with Pier Giacomo in 1957 incorporated tractor and bicycle seats into new stools. He created hundreds of pieces of furniture, lighting and products for a distinguished client list including Kartell, Knoll, Zanotta, Alessi and Siemens. With more than 800 photographs and drawings, this monograph does full justice to his designs, which won eight prestigious Compasso d'Oro prizes.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/4/1/41pvex997fl._sx445_bo1,204,203,200_.u2487.d20160513.t105015.jpg"]},{"name":"AD - Architecture Design 2","brand":null,"price":"1.080.000 ₫","description":"AD - Architecture Design 2","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/d/o/download (2).u383.d20160517.t162934.jpg","https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/t/i/tiki_19.u547.d20160510.t082048_2_1_1_2_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_2_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1.jpg"]},{"name":"Chinese Houses Of Southeast Asia - Paperback","brand":"Ronald G.

Knapp traveled throughout Southeast Asia, searching out homes built by the first generations of successful Chinese settlers during the late eighteenth to the early twentieth century. In Chinese Houses of Southeast Asia, Knapp presents an eye-opening account of how Chinese migration into Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam spawned a unique hybrid architectural style that combined Chinese, European, and local influences.Many of these overseas Chinese heritage homes are disappearing, but Knapp—along with renowned photographer A. Chester Ong—visited a number of the shophouses, bungalows, villas, and mansions that remain.More than three dozen of these elegant residences form the core of this book, and through essays, historic photographs, paintings, and line drawings, Knapp draws an illuminating portrait of each residence along with background information about the families who built and lived in them. These profiles reveal the entrepreneurial spirit of the Chinese as well as their social and economic circumstances. A stunning marriage of scholarship and photography, Chinese Houses of Southeast Asia explores a little known branch of Chinese architecture and provides a new perspective on Chinese migration, settlement, and identity in Southeast Asia.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/6/1/61+ochjm2al._sx377_bo1,204,203,200_.u2487.d20160514.t114342.jpg"]},{"name":"Discovering The Best Hotels - Hardcover","brand":"Huang Dan","price":"3.375.000 ₫","description":"Discovering The Best Hotels","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/3/1/31kaghias8l._bo1,204,203,200_.u2487.d20160514.t143924.jpg"]},{"name":"AIA 2010 - 2012: Designs for the New Decade - Hardcover","brand":"Design Media Publishing Limited","price":"929.500 ₫","description":"AIA 2010 - 2012: Designs for the New Decade\r\nIn the book, the AIA recognizes three years worth of award recipients across four categories: architecture, interior architecture, regional, and urban design, and its esteemed Twenty-Five Year Award.

That architecture is one of the major sources of greenhouse gases in the world makes this new trend all the more significant. This book brings the best examples of green projects from the Architecture Now! series together with numerous new, never-seen-before projects. Well-known architects like Frank Gehry and Norman Foster are present right alongside young, up-and-coming creators from Latin America, the United States, Europe, and Asia.

While called 25 Tropical Houses in Singapore and Malaysia, this book is at its heart about buildings that share a common spirit: structures that are home to a diverse cross-section of families around Singapore and Malaysia.Positioned as a global city at the hub of South East Asia, Singapore has a thoroughly modern sensibility balanced by an inherited culture and sense of place. This new global consciousness is reflected in its architecture, which demonstrates a seamless marriage of vernacular and modernist forms. The luxury homes in this book illustrate how architects work with, rather than against, the singular landscape to generate beautiful tropical homes embellished with modern Asian decor. A new wave of highly distinctive architecture has seen Singapore recognized, for the first time, as one of the world's most dynamic architectural centers.Malaysian architecture retains a greater interest in vernacular forms, but the nation's strong economic growth has seen a push to recast the urban landscape. Architects are now working to accommodate the 'brave new world' of an affluent technocratic society within the Asian architecture vernacular currently found throughout most of the country. The most interesting new homes in Malaysia reflect a balance between traditional values and an optimistic global outlook.25 Tropical Houses in Singapore and Malaysia is an amazing source of home inspiration and insights, whether one seeks to know more about Singapore architecture, Malaysian traditions or tropical architecture in general.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51mp+tpjxjl._sx370_bo1,204,203,200_.u2487.d20160513.t094111.jpg"]},{"name":"2012 Architect Competiton Annual 7 - Paperback","brand":"Archiworld","price":"630.000 ₫","description":"2012 Architect Competiton Annual 7","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/4/1/41audbipfrl._sx331_bo1,204,203,200_.u2469.d20160514.t161900.jpg"]},{"name":"25 Tropical Houses In Singapore And Malaysia","brand":null,"price":"918.000 ₫","description":"25 Tropical Houses In Singapore And Malaysia","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/9/7/978079460528525.u383.d20160517.t162143.jpg","https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/t/i/tiki_19.u547.d20160510.t082048_2_1_1_2_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_2_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1.jpg"]},{"name":"The Tropical House - Hardcover","brand":"Elizabeth Reyes","price":"910.000 ₫","description":"The Tropical House\r\nTropical House celebrates a growing trend toward stylish globalization in interior design.\r\nMore than 25 stunning houses and condos in and around Manila, the Philippines, evoke a distinctive tropical-modern-fusion style that is gaining popularity around the world.

Bloated with debt, and outpaced by China and other emerging markets, the United States has been left for dead as an economic force. But in this time of grim predictions, Daniel Gross, Yahoo! financial columnist and author of Dumb Money, offers a refreshingly optimistic take on our nation’s economic prospects, examining the positive trends that point to a better, stronger future. \r\nWidely respected for his Newsweek and Slate coverage of the crash and the recovery, Daniel Gross shows that much of the talk about decline is misplaced. In the wake of the crash, rather than accept the inevitability of a Japan-style lost decade, America’s businesses and institutions tapped into the very strengths that built the nation’s economy into a global powerhouse in the first place: speed, ingenuity, adaptability, pragmatism, entrepreneurship, and, most significant, an ability to engage with the world. As the United States wallowed in self-pity, the world continued to see promise in what America has to offer-buying exports, investing in the United States, and adopting American companies and business models as their own. Global growth, it turns out, is not a zero-sum game. \r\nBetter, Stronger, Faster is an account of the remarkable reconstruction and reorientation that started in March 2009, a period that Gross compares to March 1933-as both marked the start of unexpected recoveries. As the U.S. public sector undertook aggressive fiscal and monetary actions, the private sector sprang into action. Companies large and small restructured, tapped into long-dormant internal resources, and invested for growth, at home and abroad. Between 2009 and 2011, as Europe struggled with a cascade of crises, the U.S. got back on its feet-and began to run. \r\nThrough stories of innovative solutions devised by policy makers, businesses, investors, and consumers, Gross explains how America has the potential to emerge from this period, not as the unrivaled ruler of the global economy but as a healthier leader and an enabler of sustainable growth.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51nwfxoldvl._sx331_bo1,204,203,200_.u547.d20160804.t170943.402964.jpg"]},{"name":"Mike The Knight: Mike And The Mighty Shield","brand":"HIT Entertainment","price":"69.000 ₫","description":"Mike The Knight: Mike And The Mighty Shield\r\nMike the Knight fends off Vikings...and learns to stay true to himself.\r\nIn this 8x8 storybook with foil on the cover, Mike the Knight finds one of his dad’s old shields.

Besides addressing these and other issues, this revised edition contains a chapter explaining how Medicare rules can shape Social Security decisions.\r\nMany other personal-finance books briefly address Social Security, but none offers the full, authoritative, yet conversational analysis of Get What’s Yours.\r\nGet What’s Yours explains Social Security benefits through basic strategies and stirring stories. It covers the most frequent benefit scenarios faced by married retired couples; by divorced retirees; by widows and widowers. It explains what to do if you’re a retired parent of dependent children; disabled; an eligible beneficiary who continues to work. It addresses the tax consequences of your choices, as well as the financial implications for other investments. It does all this and more.\r\nThere are more than 52 million Americans aged 54 to 69. Ten thousand of them reach Social Security’s full retirement age of 66 every day. For all these people-and for their families and friends-Get What’s Yours has proven to be an invaluable, and therefore indispensable, tool.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51ld6r290xl._sx332_bo1,204,203,200_.u547.d20160808.t150422.236817.jpg"]},{"name":"Passenger","brand":null,"price":"311.000 ₫","description":"Passenger\r\n“Lutz develops riveting suspense by slowly revealing the events that first sent Tanya/Amelia on the run, while pouring threats on her gritty heroine’s increasingly tenuous bids at survival.

Now, the newswoman whose biased reporting helped bring about Raley's downfall might be his only chance to vindicate himself and get justice for the fire's victims. But the more Raley and Britt discover about that fateful day, the more perilous the situation becomes, until they're not only chasing the truth but running for their lives.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/511clu+gt0l._sx273_bo1,204,203,200_.u547.d20160809.t132251.132988.jpg"]},{"name":"Code Of Conduct","brand":"Brad Thor","price":"173.000 ₫","description":"Code Of Conduct\r\n#1 New York Times bestselling author Brad Thor presents his greatest thriller ever-an action-packed tour de force that “feels like the TV show 24 on the page” (Associated Press).\r\nHidden deep within one of the world’s most powerful organizations is a secret committee with a devastating agenda.

The truth is that the typical personal improvement mantra of tapping into your willpower and activating the power of positive thinking is actually a recipe for failure.  In Beyond Willpower, bestselling author and psychological counselor Alexander Loyd, PhD, ND, reveals a unique, highly effective program to help you finally achieve the life you want and the success you deserve.  Science has proven that stress, or internal fear, is the primary source of virtually any problem we encounter– physical, spiritual, emotional, and even circumstantial. New research has shown that fear is literally programmed into us at the cellular level, which is why most of us are unable to turn off our stress response by willpower alone. For the first time, this book teaches you how to change your cellular programming from fear to love, triggering a natural chemical chain reaction that fuels you for your best success. Rooted in science, ancient wisdom, and proven therapeutic techniques to remove personal obstacles that sabotage us, Beyond Willpower offers a revolutionary 40-day holistic program based on more than 25 years of clinical experience. With this program you will identify and clarify what fundamentally defines success for you.  Then you’ll receive the three simple tools you need to internally shift from fear to love physically (using the Energy Medicine tool), mentally (using the Reprogramming Statements tool), and spiritually (using the Heart Screen tool). You'll also have free access to the unprecedented \"Success Issues Finder\" test, which accurately diagnoses your unconscious and subconscious issues related to success and failure, happiness and unhappiness. No matter how you define success – as wealth, career satisfaction, healing of health issues, or resolution of relationship problems –Beyond Willpower will help you achieve it once and for all, quickly and for the long term.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/b/e/beyond willpower.u2673.d20160912.t121410.653481.jpg"]},{"name":"Dark Places","brand":null,"price":"155.000 ₫","description":"Dark Places\r\nFROM THE #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF GONE GIRLLibby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in “The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.” She survived—and famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer.

The Whitshanks are one of those families that radiate an indefinable kind of specialness, but like all families, their stories reveal only part of the picture: Abby and Red and their four grown children have accumulated not only tender moments, laughter, and celebrations, but also jealousies, disappointments, and carefully guarded secrets. From Red’s parents, newly arrived in Baltimore in the 1920s, to the grandchildren carrying the Whitshank legacy boisterously into the twenty-first century, here are four generations of lives unfolding in and around the sprawling, lovingly worn house that has always been their anchor.Praise for A Spool of Blue Thread“An act of literary enchantment . . .

Since the late 1990s, designers have realised that the perfect showcase for their cutting-edge clothes are inspirational, innovative stores, created by like-minded architects and interior designers. From London, Paris and Milan to New York and Tokyo, shops are being refitted in a whole range of styles from fantastical 1970s-inspired futurism to pure minimalism. Like the clothes, the emphasis is on the ingenious use of both new and classic materials, with surprising angles and unexpected inspirations.\r\nWith a new preface and 28 of the latest, beautiful, fashion-retail stores designed by architects such as Rem Koolhaas, Thomas Heatherwick, Renzo Piano, Marc Newson, Future Systems and Herzog & de Meuron, this new edition of the highly acclaimed Fashion Retail shows how the top labels in the world are continuing to match radical couture with radical architecture and interiors. The new edition also highlights how accessory brands such as Longchamp have come to the fore with adventurous interiors, while department stores worldwide are being redesigned to compete at the highest level.\r\nAs Fashion Retail reveals, the labels and architects are embracing the challenges of the internet by ensuring that the stores are the ultimate, experiential destinations for the customers, whose expectations of stylish shopping environments are higher than ever.

They channel household savings to the corporate sector and allocate investment funds among firms; they allow intertemporal smoothing of consumption by households and expenditures by firms; and they enable households and firms to share risks. These functions are common to the financial systems of most developed economies. Yet the form of these financial systems varies widely. In the United States and the United Kingdom competitive markets dominate the financial landscape, whereas in France, Germany, and Japan banks have traditionally played the most important role. Why do different countries have such different financial systems? Is one system better than all the others? Do different systems merely represent alternative ways of satisfying similar needs? Is the current trend toward market-based systems desirable? Franklin Allen and Douglas Gale argue that the view that market-based systems are best is simplistic. A more nuanced approach is necessary. For example, financial markets may be bad for risk sharing; competition in banking may be inefficient; financial crises can be good as well as bad; and separation of ownership and control can be optimal. Financial institutions are not simply veils, disguising the allocation mechanism without affecting it, but are crucial to overcoming market imperfections. An optimal financial system relies on both financial markets and financial intermediaries.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/514sspe9thl._sx331_bo1,204,203,200_.u2469.d20160725.t115119.jpg"]},{"name":"An Introduction To Events Management","brand":"Louis Haynes","price":"566.000 ₫","description":"An Introduction To Events Management\r\nEngage your students with topics of immediate interest in this books unique, issues-oriented approach.

Unlike a typical architectural monograph, this book uses the comic book format to express its radical agenda for contemporary architecture. It is also the first comprehensive documentation of BIG’s trailblazing practice—where method, process, instruments and concepts are constantly questioned and redefined. Or, as the group itself says:\r\n\"Historically, architecture has been dominated by two opposing extremes: an avant-garde full of crazy ideas, originating from philosophy or mysticism; and the well organized corporate consultants that build predictable and boring boxes of high standard. Architecture seems entrenched: naively utopian or petrifyingly pragmatic. We believe there is a third way between these diametric opposites: a pragmatic utopian architecture that creates socially, economically and environmentally perfect places as a practical objective. At BIG we are devoted to investing in the overlap between radical and reality. In all our actions we try to move the focus from the little details to the BIG picture.\"\r\nBjarke Ingels attracts highly talented co-workers, but also gifted and ambitious clients from all over the world. He then creates intelligent synergies from wild energies and unforeseen dynamics, and transforms them into surprising, functional, valuable and beautiful solutions to the specific and complex challenges in each task.\r\nBIG projects have won awards from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, and the Special Jury Prize at the Venice Architecture Biennale, as well as many other international prizes.

Texts such as 'Could you live without money?' really help to generate opinion and discussion.\r\nThey create a desire to communicate.\r\nHaving created the desire, American English File then helps you to develop learners' communication skills. One way it does this is with a strong focus on pronunciation.\r\nResearch shows that poor pronunciation is a major contributor to breakdowns in communication (Jennifer Jenkins: The Phonology of English as an International Language).\r\nAmerican English File integrates pronunciation into every lesson - the 'little and often' approach. But that's not all.\r\nThe unique English File Sounds Chart puts a picture to each sound in the phonetic alphabet, so learners find it easier to remember the sounds and, ultimately, improve their pronunciation.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/518cyyzxg5l-_sx394_bo1-204-203-200_.u2469.d20161007.t140241.794875.jpg"]},{"name":"Our Discovery Island (Bre) 3: Student Book Plus Pin Code","brand":"Debbie Peters - Anne Feunteun","price":"147.000 ₫","description":"Our Discovery Island (Bre) 3: Student Book Plus Pin Code\r\nEach level of the Pupil's Book contains a Welcome unit and 8 units each designed for 2-3 hours of class per week.

Lockwood, the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange, situated on the bleak Yorkshire moors, is forced to seek shelter one night at Wuthering Heights, the home of his landlord. There he discovers the history of the tempestuous events that took place years before; of the intense relationship between the gypsy foundling Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw; and how Catherine, forced to choose between passionate, tortured Heathcliff and gentle, well-bred Edgar Linton, surrendered to the expectations of her class. As Heathcliff's bitterness and vengeance at his betrayal is visited upon the next generation, their innocent heirs must struggle to escape the legacy of the past. In this edition, a new preface by Lucasta Miller, author of The Brontë Myth, looks at the ways in which the novel has been interpreted, from Charlotte Brontë onwards. This complements Pauline Nestor's introduction, which discusses changing critical receptions of the novel, as well as Emily Brontë's influences and background. Emily Brontë (1818-48), along with her sisters, Charlotte and Anne, was one of the most significant literary figures of the 19th century. She wrote just one strikingly innovative novel, Wuthering Heights, but was also a gifted and intense poet. If you enjoyed Wuthering Heights, you may like Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre, also available in Penguin Classics.

And yet Maria has a traumatic history of her own, one that compelled her to return to her hometown and left her questioning so much of what she once believed.A chance encounter on a rain-swept road will alter the course of both Colin and Maria's lives, challenging deeply held assumptions about each other and ultimately, themselves. As love unexpectedly takes hold between them, they dare to envision what a future together could possibly look like . . . until menacing reminders of events in Maria's past begin to surface.Rich in emotion and fueled with suspense, SEE ME reminds us that love is sometimes forged in the crises that threaten to shatter us . . . and that those who see us for who we truly are may not always be the ones easiest to recognize.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51e4ntry8gl-_sx328_bo1-204-203-200_.u2487.d20161031.t145209.808107.jpg"]},{"name":"The Help","brand":null,"price":"276.000 ₫","description":"The Help","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51lcq8djhrl-_sx304_bo1-204-203-200_.u1811.d20161213.t092431.447334.jpg"]},{"name":"Wild","brand":"Cheryl Strayed","price":"242.000 ₫","description":"Wild\r\nOprah's Book Club 2.0 selection.\r\nA powerful, blazingly honest memoir: the story of an eleven-hundred-mile solo hike that broke down a young woman reeling from catastrophe—and built her back up again.\r\nAt twenty-two, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything. In the wake of her mother's death, her family scattered and her own marriage was soon destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life: to hike the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State—and to do it alone. She had no experience as a long-distance hiker, and the trail was little more than \"an idea, vague and outlandish and full of promise.\" But it was a promise of piecing back together a life that had come undone.\r\nStrayed faces down rattlesnakes and black bears, intense heat and record snowfalls, and both the beauty and loneliness of the trail.

Why are there dozens of varieties of mustard-but only one variety of ketchup? What do football players teach us about how to hire teachers? What does hair dye tell us about the history of the 20th century?In the past decade, Malcolm Gladwell has written three books that have radically changed how we understand our world and ourselves: The Tipping Point; Blink; and Outliers. Now, in What the Dog Saw, he brings together, for the first time, the best of his writing from The New Yorker over the same period.Here is the bittersweet tale of the inventor of the birth control pill, and the dazzling inventions of the pasta sauce pioneer Howard Moscowitz. Gladwell sits with Ron Popeil, the king of the American kitchen, as he sells rotisserie ovens, and divines the secrets of Cesar Millan, the \"dog whisperer\" who can calm savage animals with the touch of his hand. He explores intelligence tests and ethnic profiling and \"hindsight bias\" and why it was that everyone in Silicon Valley once tripped over themselves to hire the same college graduate.\"Good writing,\" Gladwell says in his preface, \"does not succeed or fail on the strength of its ability to persuade. It succeeds or fails on the strength of its ability to engage you, to make you think, to give you a glimpse into someone else's head.\" What the Dog Saw is yet another example of the buoyant spirit and unflagging curiosity that have made Malcolm Gladwell our most brilliant investigator of the hidden extraordinary.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/4/1/41drkn1rysl-_sx325_bo1-204-203-200_.u2487.d20161031.t150516.459981.jpg"]},{"name":"The Last Mile (Amos Decker Series)","brand":"David Baldacci","price":"129.000 ₫","description":"The Last Mile (Amos Decker Series)","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51d9aqnv1kl-_sx318_bo1-204-203-200_.u2487.d20161031.t152014.363246.jpg"]},{"name":"Crisis Of Character","brand":"Gary J.

This paperback edition includes an author's note highlighting the differences between the fictional story and true events, a version of the author's Newbery Medal acceptance speech, Ivan's \"signature,\" discussion questions, and more.\r\nThe One and Only Ivan is a strong Common Core title that features these important strands and standards: first-person narrative; author's use of literary devices (personification, imagery); story elements (plot, character development, perspective).","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/5/1/51dlkub2rol-_sx352_bo1-204-203-200_.u2469.d20161216.t135427.716698.jpg"]},{"name":"The Economist: China's Digital Dictatorship - 51","brand":null,"price":"156.400 ₫","description":"The Economist: China's Digital Dictatorship\r\n \r\n- Output, prices and jobs\r\n- Trade, exchange rates, budget balances and interest rates\r\n- World GDP\r\n- The Economist commodity-price index\r\n- Markets\r\n\r\n ","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/2/0/20161217_cap400.u547.d20161220.t085333.226382.jpg"]},{"name":"The Economist: The World In 2017","brand":null,"price":"332.350 ₫","description":"The Economist: The World In 2017\r\nRevolution will be in the air in 2017.

In theory, he argues, the world's wealthiest countries and supra-national institutions like the IMF, World Bank and WTO want to see all nations developing into modern industrial societies. In practice, though, those at the top are 'kicking away the ladder' to wealth that they themselves climbed. Why? Self-interest certainly plays a part. But, more often, rich and powerful governments and institutions are actually being 'Bad Samaritans': their intentions are worthy but their simplistic free-market ideology and poor understanding of history leads them to inflict policy errors on others. Chang demonstrates this by contrasting the route to success of economically vibrant countries with the very different route now being dictated to the world's poorer nations. In the course of this, he shows just how muddled the thinking is in such key areas as trade and foreign investment. He shows that the case for privatisation and against state involvement is far from proven. And he explores the ways in which attitudes to national cultures and political ideologies are obscuring clear thinking and creating bad policy. Finally, he argues the case for new strategies for a more prosperous world that may appall the 'Bad Samaritans'.","images":["https://vcdn.tikicdn.com/cache/w1200/media/catalog/product/9/7/9781905211371.u53.d20160829.t143052.379734.jpg"]},{"name":"Open Sesame: Big Bird's Yellow Book Stage A","brand":"Jane S.
